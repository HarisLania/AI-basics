Evolutionary and Genetic Alogrithms
1. Evolution Operators
    -> Make Chromosomes
        -> Calculate fitness
        -> Evaluate
    -> Parent Selection
        -> Binary tournament
        -> Best select
        -> Random select
    -> Crossover
        -> One point crossover
    -> Mutation
        -> mutate
    -> Post Select
        -> Best select

2. Genetic Operators
    -> Make Chromosomes
        -> Decode
        -> Calculate fitness
        -> Evaluate
    -> Parent Selection
        -> same as evolutionary
    -> Crossover
        -> One point crossover
        -> Two point crossover
    -> Mutation
        -> filp mutation
    -> Post Select
        -> same as evolutionary

3. Task in which using genotypic representation with the population of 10 and getting maximum value of a function
