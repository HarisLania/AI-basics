# Artificial Intelligence basics


### Graph Traversal Algorithms
1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search

### Informed Search Algorithms
1. A* Search
2. Uniform Cost Search

### Heuristic Search
1. Hill Climbing

### Evolutionary and Genetic Alogrithms
1. Evolution Operators
    ##### 1.0 Make Chromosomes
        -> Calculate fitness
        -> Evaluate
    ##### 1.1 Parent Selection
        -> Binary tournament
        -> Best select
        -> Random select
    ##### 1.2 Crossover
        -> One point crossover
    ##### 1.3 Mutation
        -> mutate
    1.4 Post Select
        -> Best select

2. Genetic Operators
    -> Make Chromosomes
        -> Decode
        -> Calculate fitness
        -> Evaluate
    -> Parent Selection
        -> same as evolutionary
    -> Crossover
        -> One point crossover
        -> Two point crossover
    -> Mutation
        -> filp mutation
    -> Post Select
        -> same as evolutionary

3. Task in which using genotypic representation with the population of 10 and getting maximum value of a function
